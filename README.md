### Project Description

‚ÄúPinne-Cheyyam‚Äù is a productivity killer disguised as a Chrome extension. Every time you try to do something meaningful, this extension will ensure you have to complete random, pointless tasks to proceed. Perfect for those who are tired of productivity and want more distractions in life!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are too focused on productive websites, making their lives boring. Why spend your time getting things done when you could be solving puzzles and taking quizzes instead?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Pinne-Cheyyam forces users to complete random tasks to "unlock" the productive website they‚Äôre trying to use. By spending time solving distractions, users can avoid real work and enjoy the joy of random interruptions.
